########## 2) Lemmatization : Step by step procedure of obtaing root of the word. It uses vocabulary(dictionary) and morphological analysis(Word structure & Grammer)
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
lem=WordNetLemmatizer()  #use step by step procedure to obtain root word, use dictionary, grammmer, word structure

from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
